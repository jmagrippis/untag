## Development

`.npmrc` uses a `REMIX_REGISTRY_TOKEN` you will need to export with your Remix license, in order to be able to download its closed-source code. I am not affiliated with Remix, just a curious developer who decided to splash around a little bit 🐳

You will then be able to install dependencies using `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

And run the app on localhost:3000 with:

```sh
npm start
```

This starts the Remix development server, a TypeScript watcher for your server code, and the vercel development server.
